# DJ Library Tool
An open-source audio library tool that helps DJs avoid compatibility issues between different software.

## Features
- BPM and Key estimation with Essentia's pre-trained CNN models â€“ similar accuracy to Rekordbox, better than Serato DJ.
- The estimations are automatically added to the songs' title and meta (e.g. `[123-06A] audiofilename.mp3`).
- The key estimation is in camelot key notation by default for easy usage.
- Converts everything to mp3. It keeps the original files and move them into a separate folder (default: /originals).
- Supported formats: wav, mp3, flac, aif
